# flask1
This is the progress I have made in order to better understand Flask in python and its many capabilties.
I learned how to use python inside of html file as well as a few redirect techniques
<li>changing the html depending on what the user types in the url search bar</li>
<li>saving input in the url search bar as a variable and displaying it on screen</li>
I also learned the basics of template inheritance and how multiple files can inherit certain aspects from eachother
